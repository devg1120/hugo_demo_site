YUSA, along with the YMCA Website Services partner agencies, host a monthly call where we update the community on the distribution, demo new features, and answer community questions.

As of September 2024, calls are held on the second Wednesday of the month at 11AM Central Time. YMCAs, partner developers, or other interested parties are welcome to [contact us](<mailto:ycloud@ymca.net?subject=Monthly Meeting Invitation Request>) for an invitation.
