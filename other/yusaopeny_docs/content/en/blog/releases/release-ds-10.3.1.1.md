## Updates & New Features

### Promotion Content Type

**Promotions** are pieces of content with scheduled start and end dates that can be used for displaying internal marketing and ad campaigns. Content editors can easily schedule, manage and place multiple promotions throughout their website via the Drupal admin interface.

The first version of this content type allows content editors to place promotions inside the Card component (for Layout Builder) and as interstitial content within Activity Finder.  [Learn more in our docs.](https://ds-docs.y.org/docs/user-documentation/content-types/promotion/)
