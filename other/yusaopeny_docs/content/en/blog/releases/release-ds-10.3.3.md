## Updates & New Features

### Drupal Updates

Learn more about the improvements in [Drupal 10.1](https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-10-1-0) and [Drupal 10.2](https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-10-2-0).

For users who wish to apply all the updates below _without_ Drupal 10.2, we've released [YMCA Website Services 10.3.2.4](https://github.com/YCloudYUSA/yusaopeny/releases/tag/10.3.2.4). This can be applied as a stepping stone to Drupal 10.2, but we recommend moving to 10.2 as community security support for Drupal 10.0 [ended in December 2023](https://endoflife.date/drupal).

* Updated to Drupal core version 10.2. (#758)
    * **NOTE:** This release will work with Drupal 10.1 or Drupal 10.2. Run `composer require drupal/core-recommended:"^10.1" -W` to force your site to use Drupal 10.1.
* Updated to OpenY map version 5.2. (#1497)
