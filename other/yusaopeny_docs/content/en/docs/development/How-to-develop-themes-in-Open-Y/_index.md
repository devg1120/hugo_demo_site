# Working with Themes

Each YMCA Website Services theme was developed independently, either by the YMCA Website Services Core Team or by a partner for one specific Y and then contributed back. You can see demos of each theme on the [Sandboxes]({{< relref "Sandboxes.md" >}}).

Each theme has its own dependencies and build processes. Please read the steps in each `README` for details.

## Inventory of themes

As of December 2021, themes [have been decoupled](https://github.com/YCloudYUSA/yusaopeny/pull/2595) from the YMCA Website Services profile to independent projects on Drupal.org.
