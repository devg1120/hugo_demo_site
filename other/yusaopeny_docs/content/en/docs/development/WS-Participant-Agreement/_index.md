**YMCA Website Services PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT**

This YMCA Website Services Participation Agreement (this “**Agreement**”) is between YUSA, and participating YMCA member associations in the United States (“**Member Associations**”). YUSA has received license rights from the National Council of Young Men’s Christian Associations of the United States of America, an Illinois not-for-profit corporation (“**YUSA**”) to provide the Platform (as defined below) to you.

The purpose of the YMCA Website Services community is to collectively advance YMCA web and online experiences to better serve the YMCA mission. The terms of this Agreement govern your use of YMCA Website Services’s open-source digital content management system, which facilitates the sharing of YUSA brand-compliant website templates, tools, applications, and related digital assets (“**Platform**”). The community provides a collaborative environment for individuals to positively interact and participate in the Platform. These guidelines address the standards and expectations of those contributing to and participating in the YMCA Website Services community and are meant to help our YMCA community grow and thrive. Your participation in YMCA Website Services means that you agree to the following guidelines and to the YMCA Website Services Terms of Use.

**YMCA BRAND ASSETS**

No right is granted by this Agreement to use or license the YUSA brand assets. YMCA brand assets, which include, but are not limited to YMCA trademarks, trade dress, logos and other indicia of origin, are owned and controlled by YUSA. _YUSA provides the Platform to you under license from YUSA. Accordingly, neither YUSA nor any Member Association shall, either directly or indirectly, at any time do any act or thing contesting the validity of YUSA’s trademarks or its rights thereto._

Only Member Associations in the United States will have access to use any YUSA brand assets included in YMCA Website Services. All use by Member Associations must be in compliance with YUSA brand standards and guidelines as established by the National Board. YUSA is a third party beneficiary to this Agreement, with the right to enforce each of the terms of this Agreement with respect to YMCA Website Services and you. YMCA Website Services shall send copies of all notices due to you under this Agreement to each of you and YUSA.

**BEING A MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY**

_Participation_: YMCA Website Services will be at its best if each member participates in the community. There are many different ways you can participate, including through using the platform, presentations, forums, summits, emails, calls, etc. We encourage your active participation to the extent you feel you are able and willing. YUSA may publicly disclose your participation in the project.

_Contribution_: YMCA Website Services encourages Members to contribute to the enhancement, editing, and building of YMCA Website Services. To ensure valuable contributions to the community, YMCA Website Services encourages Members to stay familiar and up-to-date with the YMCA Website Services roadmap, as well as new features in active development. When you make changes that improve YMCA Website Services features, please contribute those back to the community by ensuring they are re-useable and decoupled.

_Collaboration_: YMCA Website Services encourages Members to collaborate across the YMCA community to share costs and efforts on building new capabilities.

_Transparency_: Customizations of code provided by YMCA Website Services for your website will likely increase the initial fees, support, and upgrade costs for your website. When modifying or redistributing code, you must include a notice giving credit to YMCA Website Services for the portion of the YMCA Website Services code you use.

_Promotion_: YMCA Website Services encourages Members to share their expertise and YMCA Website Services experience to expand its reach and accessibility to experienced and new members alike. There will be many opportunities for members to support YMCA Website Services and its marketing and messaging initiatives.
