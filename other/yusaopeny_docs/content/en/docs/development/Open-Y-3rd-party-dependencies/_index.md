YMCA Website Services's system requirements generally track [those of Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/docs/system-requirements) with some occasional more opinionated recommendations.

## General Requirements

Supported versions may differ based on your Drupal version.

- A [supported web server](https://www.drupal.org/docs/system-requirements/web-server-requirements) like Apache or Nginx
- A [supported database server](https://www.drupal.org/docs/system-requirements/database-server-requirements) like MySQL or MariaDB
- A [supported version of PHP](https://www.drupal.org/docs/system-requirements/php-requirements)
- A Linux-based operating system
  - [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) 16, 18, and 20 are supported.
  - CentOS or similar may work as well.

Recommended for advanced functionality, but not required:

- [Apache SOLR](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) search server
  - Version 4.9.1 and version 8 have been tested for Activity Finder. Other versions are works in progress.

### For high load/performance sites

- A memory-based key-value store
  - [Memcache](http://memcached.org/)
  - [Redis](https://redis.io)
- A reverse proxy/HTTP cache
  - [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/)
  - [Nginx reverse proxy](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/)
