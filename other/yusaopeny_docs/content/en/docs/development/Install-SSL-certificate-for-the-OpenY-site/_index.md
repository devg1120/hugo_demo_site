## Web Security and YMCA Website Services

As many parties have moved to [Encrypt the Web](https://www.eff.org/encrypt-the-web), `https` sites and SSL certificates have shifted from "nice to have" to necessities.

If you're running YMCA Website Services on a managed platform you most likely have SSL already configured. If you choose to manage YMCA Website Services on your own, you'll have to install a certificate.

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is "a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA), run for the public’s benefit. It is a service provided by the [Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)](https://www.abetterinternet.org/)." [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is "a free, open source software tool for automatically using Let’s Encrypt certificates on manually-administrated websites to enable HTTPS."

Certbot maintains detailed documentation for installing SSL certificates on a variety of systems. Simply [visit Certbot's instructions wizard](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions) and follow the instructions to configure your server.
