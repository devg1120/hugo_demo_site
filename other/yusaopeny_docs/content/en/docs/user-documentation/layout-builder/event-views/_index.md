The distribution provides a few blocks to highlight events. 

- Featured Events
- Events Filter
- Events Listing

To use the blocks:

- Click the **Layout** tab at the top of your page
- Scroll to the location on the page where you want to add a block
- Click **Add block**
- In the sidebar, click **Create custom block**
- Choose each block to add.

## Featured Events

Displays one or more events in a large feature on the page.

- **Title** (required): Displayed if **Display title** is checked, otherwise this is for administrative use.
- **Manual selection items**: Select one or more events to be featured on the page. Generally it's best to just feature a single event.

## Events filter

Allows users to filter the Events Listing by location, category, or text search.

- **Title** (required): Displayed if **Display title** is checked, otherwise this is for administrative use.

This block has no other options.

## Events listing

Displays events in a teaser view, filtered by the **Events filter** block, showing 6 at a time with a "Show more" button

- **Title** (required): Displayed if **Display title** is checked, otherwise this is for administrative use.
