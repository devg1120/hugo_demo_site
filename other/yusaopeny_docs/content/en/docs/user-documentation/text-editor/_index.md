This tool allows you the flexibility to format content however you want within a certain container or area.

Bundled with the Drupal core and the distribution, [CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/feature-rich/) provides a number of different buttons for styling and formatting, as well as a Source editor if you are so inclined to edit HTML directly.

CKEditor has been [upgraded to version 5](https://www.drupal.org/node/3308362) as of Drupal 10, and is a big improvement over CKEditor 4 — the linking experience is much smoother, uploading images is much faster, and more.
