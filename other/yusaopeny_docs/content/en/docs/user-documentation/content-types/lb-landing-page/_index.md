title: Landing Page (Layout Builder)
description: A flexible content type that uses Sections and Blocks, managed with Layout Builder, to build content.

This page is the base for building pages with [Layout Builder](../../layout-builder).

## Creating a Landing Page

Go to **Admin** > **Content** > **Add Content** > **Landing Page (Layout Builder)**

Fill in the content fields:

- **Title** (required): The title of the page. It will not be added to the page and should be added manually with a block in the [Banner section](#customizing-a-landing-page).
- **Metadata**: This content is used to provide context to search engines and page previews. For the best user experience create [clickable titles](https://backlinko.com/on-page-seo#optimize-title-and-description-tags), [write a compelling description](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description), and [add a descriptive image](https://yoast.com/image-seo/#always).
  - **Meta description**: A brief and concise summary of the page's content that is a maximum of 160 characters in length.
  - **Meta image**: Choose or upload an image to be used as a thumbnail for social sharing and preview cards.
  - **Meta tags**: Advanced meta tag configuration. This section should not be edited unless you know what you're doing.

## Customizing a Landing Page

Once you create a Landing Page you can customize it with [Layout Builder](../../layout-builder).

Landing Pages come with these pre-configured sections:

- [**Header**](../../layout-builder/header-footer/#header-section)
- **Banner**: An edge-to-edge, no gutters section that works best with a single [Banner](../../layout-builder/banner) or [Carousel](../../layout-builder/carousel).
- **Body**: A section with left and right margins. This can contain the bulk of your page content.
- [**Footer**](../../layout-builder/header-footer/#footer-section)

Sections can be [edited, reordered, or removed](../../layout-builder/#sections) to configure your page as you like. You can even remove the header and footer altogether if you need to create content for a digital display or other embedded system.
