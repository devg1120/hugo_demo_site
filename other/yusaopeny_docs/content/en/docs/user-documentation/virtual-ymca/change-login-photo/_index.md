Please follow these steps if you wish to customize the photo users will see when they log into the Virtual Y site.

For updating the image *before* the user logs in...

3. In the grid, find "Virtual YMCA Login" and click the Edit button for that row.
4. Expand the "Header Area"
5. Click the "Edit" button next in the Banner row.
