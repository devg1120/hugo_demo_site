title: Managing Footer LInks

Your standalone Virtual Y site may have a block with social media links at the bottom of the page. These links can be customized for many social media services.

## Getting to the block editor

Your site may have a "Quick Edit" icon (a tiny pencil) that pops up when you hover over the section with the links. If so, click the pencil, then **Edit**.

OR

If you don't see the Quick Edit option, you can navigate to the block editor at **Structure** > **Block Layout** > **Custom Block Library** > **Edit Footer Social Block**
