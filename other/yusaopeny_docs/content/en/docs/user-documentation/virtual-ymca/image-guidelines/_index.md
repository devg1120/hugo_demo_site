title: "Image Guidelines"
---

Virtual Y uses Drupal's [Image Styles](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/structure-image-styles.html) concept to "allow you to upload a single image but display it in several ways." Because of this, there are not specific image dimensions required for images in your Virtual Y site.

We can, however, provide guidance on what images work best for the image styles being used on the site:

- Use high-resolution images if possible, but compress them using a tool like [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/) to make sure they are no more than 1-2MB.
- Use landscape-orientation images with a 4:3 or 16:9 ratio. These are common formats so often no cropping is necessary.
- Square images are NOT recommended, as they are often cropped in unexpected ways.
- Images are sometimes cropped from the top and bottom, so ensure faces or other focal points are in the vertical center of the image.
