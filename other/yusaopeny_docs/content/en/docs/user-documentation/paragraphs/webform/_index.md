## How to Use Webform

> **Prerequisite**: You must have your web form created before embedding onto a page. While you can continue to revise and edit your form, using this paragraph will NOT create a webform for you.

Once you’ve selected *Webform* from the paragraphs dropdown, select the name of the webform you want to embed onto your page.

Next, you will have the option to open, close or schedule your open/close dates for your webform.

> Ignore the “Default submission pairs” field, unless you’re [a YAML wizard](https://yaml.org) and want to have some default values for certain fields in case your users forget to fill them out.
