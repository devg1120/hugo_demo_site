## How it Works

* Select 4 Columns from the Paragraphs dropdown
* **Title**: Optional large, all-caps title at the top
* **Line Above**: Adds a horizontal rule above each column.

![landing-page__line-above](paragraphs--4c--line-above.png)

* **Description**: A subheader/section description embedded below the title and above your titles. [Uses the text editor](../../text-editor/basic-text-formatting) for styling.
* Add custom blocks to the First Column, Second Column, Third Column, Fourth Column.

> **Adding Headers to Individual Blocks**
> Out of the box, the *Title field* in each *custom block* renders as plain text. To work around this, add your headers in the text editor.
>
> See *Advanced* below for details about how to fix this with CSS.

If you want to add multiple rows of content with 4 columns, add a new 4 columns paragraph for each set of two you want (e.g., if you have seven blocks of content, add two 4 columns paragraphs).

## Advanced

### Title Field Styling

In all three themes currently in YMCA Website Services, the Title field displays in a font-size and color nearly identical to the body copy. To override, target `.field-sb-title`.

### Carnation -> Columns stack in desktop

In order for this to work in Carnation, the `.wrapper` containing the column elements needs to be changed to `.row`; otherwise, each of the four columns expands to the full width of the Area it’s embedded in.
