These three paragraphs embed a listing of News posts, sorted by the most recent, in a row/listing design

* **Latest News Posts** shows all the most recent news posts across your entire site.
* **Latest News Posts (Branch)** filters news posts by the branch the paragraph is embedded on (for example, if on a Downtown YMCA page, only Downtown YMCA news posts will show up). Placed on a non-branch page, only the headline will show up.
* **Latest News Posts (Camp)** filters News posts by the branch the paragraph is embedded on (for example, if on a Camp Widjiwagan page, only Camp Widjiwagan YMCA News posts will show up). Placed on a non-camp page, only the headline will show up.
