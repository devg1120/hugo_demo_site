## How to Add/Edit a Gallery

Once you’ve selected a gallery from the paragraphs dropdown, enter a *Headline* for the gallery.

Next, if you would like to add a subhead or description below your title, add it below the headline in the *Description* field.

> Only use basic text formatting on your description, such headlines. Avoid using bullets or numbered lists in this field.

Optionally, you can add a Link in the link field.

Below the link field, you will add your images. Click on the *Add images* button to select the pictures for your gallery. You can upload an image to the media library, or select multiple images from your library.

Once you’ve uploaded/selected your images, click that blue *Add images* button at the bottom.

To order your images, hover your mouse over the thumbnail in the “Images” section, and then drag them to reorder. You will see a cross-arrow icon when you’re dragging them around, similar to what you see when you reorder paragraphs.
