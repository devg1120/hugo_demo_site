## How to Use the Promo Card

In your sidebar area, select *Add Promo Card* from the paragraphs list.

You can add an optional large *Title* in the top text field, while the required *Headline* field puts a smaller headline below the title.

The description field is a text editor that allows you to enter any content you want with the standard text editor options.
