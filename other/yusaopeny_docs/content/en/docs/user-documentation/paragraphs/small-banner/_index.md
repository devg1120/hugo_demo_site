## How to Use a Small Banner

Select *Add Small Banner* from the paragraphs dropdown. Then, fill out the following fields:

* **Title (required):** This field adds a headline to your banner. The placement of the title will depend on your theme and customization, but it will typically appear as large, all-caps text.
* **Color (required):** The background color for your banner. In Lily and Rose, this background color displays behind your title and description.
  > In Carnation, you will not see the background color unless you choose not to add an image.
* **Description (optional):** Displays beneath your Title. You have the option to style your text using the text editor, but it’s not as consistent as other places where you typically see the editor..
* **Image:**  Use the image library to embed an image. You can upload a new image from your computer or reuse an existing image from your library. The image field is optional, but recommended.
  * *Note -> This does not work in Rose.*
  For recommended image sizes for your YMCA Website Services site, talk to your agency partner.

  > *Note: Unlike [the Banner](../banner), Small Banners don’t come with a specific Link field for buttons without customization.
  >
  > To add a button to a small banner, you can [use the Text Editor button tool](../../text-editor/building-buttons) to create a button in your description field.
