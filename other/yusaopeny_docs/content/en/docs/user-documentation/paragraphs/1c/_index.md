## How to Use 1 Column

After selecting “1 Column” from the paragraphs dropdown, you will notice paragraph title field, a checkbox, and a required description.

* **Paragraph title** adds an all-caps heading at the top of your paragraph. This is optional.
* **The checkbox** adds dual horizontal rules. Check this only if you’re planning on using the paragraph title
* **Description (required)** - Adds simple text [through a text editor.](../../text-editor) Font color defaults to purple in Lily and Rose.

### Custom Block Feature

While the paragraph be used only with the fields above, 1 column also supports custom blocks of content. For this paragraph type, it’s recommended that users stick with “Simple block” types.

When adding your custom block, use the font-awesome icon class instead of the custom icon image field. In Carnation, the image option tends to get too large.

## Advanced

The purple font color for paragraph descriptions can be overridden in Lily and Rose by targeting .paragraph-1c-wrapper .field-prgf-1c-description.

**Example:**

    .paragraph-1c-wrapper .field-prgf-1c-description {
    color: inherit;
    }
