## How To Use Code

* Select “Add Code” from the paragraphs dropdown.

  ![admin--code__paragraph-dropdown](paragraphs-code-dropdown.png)
* You will see two buttons - one to add a custom block, the other to search for a custom block.

* To search for an existing custom block, type the name of the block in the autocomplete field and click on an option that appears to embed that block.

* To add a new block, click the “Add New Custom Block” button.

* When you add your block, you will see a blank, unformatted text field. Type your HTML text into this field.

> ***To use code, you must add HTML tags.***
>
> *Hard returns will be ignored, and text will be printed out in one long string.*
>
> *Code will not highlight or color-code your HTML.*

>There is an option to change to a “Full HTML” text editor, which will allow you to make use of the default text editor; however, using this will strip “faulty” HTML out of your block and may prevent you from using certain tags.

Once you’re done, click the button that either says *Add custom block* or *Update custom block*, depending on the option you had selected at first.
