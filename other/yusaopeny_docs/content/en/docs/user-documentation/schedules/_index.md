title: Schedules
description: The distribution provides two separate applications for managing schedules at your YMCA.
---

Under the hood, both of these applications use the [Activity/Class/Session Content Types](../content-types/activity-class-session) and the [YMCA Sync](https://github.com/ymcatwincities/ymca_sync) module to import content from an external API. These pieces together comprise the "Program Event Framework" which is highlighted in [a case study on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/case-study/schedules).
