title: Demo Content
description: The distribution comes with demo content to help kick-start your site building.
---

Two sets of demo content are available for the distribution:

- For Paragraphs-based sites: [openy_demo_content](https://github.com/open-y-subprojects/openy_demo_content)
- For Layout Builder-based sites: [y_lb_demo_content](https://github.com/YCloudYUSA/y_lb_demo_content)

These modules also contain significant boilerplate migration code that a developer would need to migrate content from an older Drupal site or different CMS into the distribution.

Demo content is also installed on the [Sandboxes](../../development/sandboxes).
