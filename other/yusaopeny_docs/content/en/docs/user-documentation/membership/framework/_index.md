The Membership Framework is distributed in the [`openy_memberships` repository](https://github.com/YCloudYUSA/yusaopeny_memberships) and must be [added and installed](https://github.com/YCloudYUSA/yusaopeny_memberships#installation) on top of the base distribution. We recommend working with your development partner if you wish to go this route.

Check out the [Membership Framework sandboxes](../../../wiki/sandboxes/#membership-framework-sandboxes) for a demonstration.
