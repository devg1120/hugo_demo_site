Doing a content audit is a useful first step to planning a migration. You can use our [content audit template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kP4JuXEKP6SFZHzqkUmv1KoTGECFOYaTPzgOc0Lyo-c/edit#gid=0) and watch our walkthrough on the [May Monthly Call](https://youtu.be/Dtaeo9Mf6Ac?t=251) to get started, then follow these steps:

## Audit

List current website pages in a spreadsheet by menu section.

- This will give you a visual overview of how your site is structured.
  - Be sure to audit your Drupal Admin back end for unpublished pages that can be removed/deleted!

## Review

Visit each page and review content.

- Identify key pages & content types
- Locate content that is outdated, duplicated, needs further review, consolidation etc.
- Find content gaps - what might be missing?
- Identify commonly used page components (i.e. Cards, Carousels, Accordions, Ping Pongs, etc.)
