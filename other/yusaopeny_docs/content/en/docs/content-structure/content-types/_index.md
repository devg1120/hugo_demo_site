Welcome to the YMCA Website Services Content Types documentation

In terms of YMCA Website Services - content types are ```bundles``` of ```node``` entity of the Drupal Framework.
You can find a much more low level documentation at [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8).

YMCA Website Services has a bunch of content types shipped for the convenience of usage the resulting site.
We are not limiting amount of content types, could be added by developers, so the list is not final.
The only rule we are trying to follow is to cover shipped list of content types by YMCA Website Services upgrade path.
