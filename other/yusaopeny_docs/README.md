# YMCA Website Services Docs

This repository stores documentation of the YMCA Website Services ecosystem that could be [read here](https://ds-docs.y.org/)

[Docsy][] is a [Hugo theme module][] for technical documentation sites, providing easy
site navigation, structure, and more. This **YMCA Website Services Docs Project** uses the
Docsy theme to serve documentation for the [YMCA Website Services](https://ds.ymca.org/) distribution.

You can find detailed theme instructions in the [Docsy user guide][].


## Working with this repo

To contribute to this repo:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/YCloudYUSA/yusaopeny_docs)

OR (the old-fashioned way)...

1. Fork this repo if you're not a maintainer.

2. Clone the repo, being sure to include the submodules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YCloudYUSA/yusaopeny_docs.git
```

You can now edit your own versions of the site’s source files.

If you want to do SCSS edits and want to publish these, you need to install `PostCSS`

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the website locally

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in our
[Getting started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites-and-installation) guide.

Once you've made your working copy of the site repo, from the repo root folder, run [hugo server](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_server/):

```
hugo server
```

## Running a container locally

You can run openy_docs inside a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
container, the container runs with a volume bound to the `openy_docs`
folder. This approach doesn't require you to install any dependencies other
than [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on
Windows and Mac, and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
on Linux.

1. Build the docker image

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

1. Run the built image

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   > NOTE: You can run both commands at once with `docker-compose up --build`.

1. Verify that the service is working.

   Open your web browser and type `http://localhost:1313` in your navigation bar,
   This opens a local instance of the openy_docs homepage. You can now make
   changes to the YMCA Website Services Docs and those changes will immediately show up in your
   browser after you save.

### Cleanup

To stop Docker Compose, on your terminal window, press **Ctrl + C**.

To remove the produced images run:

```console
docker-compose rm
```
For more information see the [Docker Compose
documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/).

## Troubleshooting

As you run the website locally, you may run into the following error:

```
➜ hugo server

INFO 2021/01/21 21:07:55 Using config file:
Building sites … INFO 2021/01/21 21:07:55 syncing static files to /
Built in 288 ms
Error: Error building site: TOCSS: failed to transform "scss/main.scss" (text/x-scss): resource "scss/scss/main.scss_9fadf33d895a46083cdd64396b57ef68" not found in file cache
```

This error occurs if you have not installed the extended version of Hugo.
See this [section](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/docsy-as-module/installation-prerequisites/#install-hugo) of the user guide for instructions on how to install Hugo.

Or you may encounter the following error:

```
➜ hugo server
Error: failed to download modules: binary with name "go" not found
```

This error occurs if you have not installed the `go` programming language on your system.
See this [section](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/docsy-as-module/installation-prerequisites/#install-go-language) of the user guide for instructions on how to install `go`.
